                <h3>About</h3>
                <span>
                    I’m a FullStack Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience in web and mobile development. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with companies such as Vodafone UK, Vodafone Portugal, INMET, and Interlegis, contributing to projects ranging from large-scale enterprise platforms to public sector systems.<br /><br />
                    My main expertise lies in React, Node.js, Python, and TypeScript, with a solid background in building APIs, migrating legacy systems, and developing scalable, modern interfaces within agile environments (Scrum/Kanban).<br /><br />
                    Outside of professional projects, I dedicate time to exploring new technologies and strengthening my engineering toolkit. I’ve been working on personal full-stack applications using Next.js, Docker, and GitHub Actions, deploying them in VPS environments with CI/CD pipelines. These projects allow me to stay current with modern practices while experimenting with architecture, automation, and performance optimization.<br /><br />
                    I’m passionate about solving real-world problems, improving delivery pipelines, and continuously evolving as a developer through hands-on learning and innovation.

                        <span class="experience-block-desc">
                            At Integer, I worked with two different clients. For one of them, I contributed to two separate teams.
                            The first was Vodafone Portugal, where I spent approximately eight months working with AEM and
                            Vue.js, developing reusable components for the company’s website. Later, I transitioned to another
                            team, where I worked for about three months using Python to support the migration of AEM pages
                            to a new model while ensuring data integrity.<br /><br />
                            Both teams followed the Scrum methodology, with four-week sprints, and used Kanban for task
                            management.<br /><br />
                            Afterwards, I joined the team at Pairpoint, where I worked as a fullstack developer. I built a product
                            showcase system using React with TypeScript on the frontend and Tornado (Python) on the
                            backend.<br /><br />
                            Similar to the previous projects, the team adopted Scrum with three-week sprints and used Kanban
                            for tracking tasks.

                            Inmet is part of the government from Brazil and is responsible, mostly, for the meteorological forecast.<br /><br />
                            I was responsible for the migration of legacy systems made in PHP to new technologies as react and node.<br /><br />
                            I also worked with React Native and made some Apps like Inmet App.<br /><br />
                            All the new systems are made with JavaScript, React and Node.<br /><br />
                            The APIs are made with REST to any system or user be able to search any information they want.<br /><br />
                            At the react frontend I used Hooks, Redux and Context API.<br /><br />
                            At the react native mobile app, I used the APIs already done and Redux for the data sending between views.<br /><br />
                            Some of the old systems need to have their data preserved, so I made scripts Python to migrate their data to the new database with the necessary adjusts.
